# Go! Indicators

<img src="logo.png" width="150" alt="the mod's logo" />

This mod allows you to add custom indicators to your progress bar.
You can set percentage, color and text for each indicator.

Settings are stored separately for each level, so you can have different indicators for each one.

You can use `\n` to add newlines in the text.
